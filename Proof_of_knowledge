Method of deployment of the service:

I chose to deploy the static website in GCS because it's an easy-to-set-up solution for such simple object as a static website.
However, if there was a plan to add some dynamic content to the site, then more suitable options of deployment should be considered (i.e. by usimg a VM).

Scalability:

GCS is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of static content, considered that we expect a moderate website traffic.
This service provides a global content delivery network (CDN) that enable us to deliver the content around the globe with quite low latency rates.
Thanks to 'pay-as-you-go' pricing model, this solution is also very cost-effective.

Some of the actions possible to implement for scaling up:
Enabling CDN mentioned above (which can be configures in Cloud Storage bucket settings) helps distributing the static content globally and reducing latensy for end users.
In case of high traffic, it is possbile to implement Google Cloud Load Balancing for the GCS bucket that will distribute the traffic and improve availability of the website.
